                        <ul>
                            <li>500 g of white beans (fabes)</li>
                            <li>250 g of cured Asturian bacon</li>
                            <li>2 Asturian chorizo</li>
                            <li>2 Asturian blood sausages</li>
                            <li>Water</li>
                            <li>200 g of ham bone</li>
                            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
                            <li>3 saffron threads</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="pl-5">Preparation:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Wash the beans to remove impurities. Leave them in a bowl of cold water to soak overnight, 
                                usually for 12 hours.</li>
                            <li>The next day, drain them and set them aside until you're ready to prepare them.</li>
                            <li>Add the beans to a preferably low and wide pot (a clay pot is even better). 
                                Cover them with water until there's about two fingers' worth of water above the beans.</li>
                            <li>Heat over high heat until it comes to a boil. When it starts boiling, add the cured bacon, chorizo sausages, 
                                ham bone, and blood sausages (previously pricked to prevent bursting).</li>
                            <li>Ensure that the blood sausages and chorizos always stay on top to prevent any potential breakage that could spoil the fabada.</li>
                            <li>Skim off the foam for a few minutes. That is, remove the foam, which typically contains impurities, and at the same time, skim off some of the fat from the broth.</li>
                            <li>After half an hour of boiling over high heat, add the saffron threads diluted in a bit of hot broth from the pot.</li>
                            <li>Reduce the cooking temperature. Add salt to taste.</li>
                            <li>Let them cook slowly over low heat for 2 hours, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon without breaking the beans. During these two hours, add cold water 
                                twice to "shock" them (interrupt the boiling and help ensure their perfect cooking).</li>
                            <li>Taste the fabada to see if the beans are tender and adjust the salt. 
                                Once they are tested and tender, remove from the heat and let it rest for about an hour.</li>
                            <li>Next, remove the chorizos, blood sausages, bacon, and ham bones. Prepare the meat by slicing the sausages generously and cutting the bacon into pieces, 
                                utilizing the meat from the ham bone. Set aside for presentation.</li>

                            <li>Cut the hake tail (keeping the skin) into 4 portions and set them aside.</li>
                            <li>Peel the garlic and onions, dice them, and sauté them in a saucepan with a drizzle of olive oil. 
                                Cook the vegetables over medium-low heat for 10 minutes. Peel the apple, chop it, and add it to the pan. 
                                Also, add the ground red pepper paste, tomato sauce, and cider. Cook everything over low heat for 10-15 minutes. 
                                Blend the ingredients with a hand blender, and if needed, strain the sauce. Set it aside.</li>
                            <li>
                                Peel and cut the potatoes into thick slices, then fry them in a pan with plenty of oil until they are golden brown. 
                                Drain and spread them in a large, shallow casserole dish. Pour the sauce over the potatoes and cook them in the sauce for 5 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Season the hake fillets with salt and pepper, and place them in the casserole dish (skin side up). 
                                Cook the fish for 4-5 minutes on each side.</li>
                            <li>Serve, sprinkle the plates with some chopped parsley, and garnish with a few parsley leaves.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>200 grams of flour</li>
                            <li>4 eggs</li>
                            <li>500 ml of whole milk</li>
                            <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon of brandy or anise</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
                            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
                            <li>Sugar for sprinkling</li>
                            <li>Extra virgin olive oil (mild)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="pl-5">Preparation:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>In a bowl, beat the eggs and add the two tablespoons of sugar. Continue to beat until they are well integrated. 
                                Incorporate the tablespoon of brandy, the milk, a pinch of salt, and the lemon zest. 
                                Beat again to mix the ingredients well.</li>
                            <li>Add the flour gradually, while continuing to incorporate it with the help of a whisk. Allow the batter to rest for about 30 minutes. 
                                This allows the flour to expand, giving you a light cream-like texture.</li>
                            <li>The quantity of "frixuelos" you get will depend on the size of the pan you're using. I used a small pan, about 20 cm in diameter. 
                                Add a drop of oil to the pan and spread it evenly across the base using a paper towel.</li>
                            <li>Just a tiny drop is sufficient; you only need to cover the surface with a very thin layer. You don't need a crepe maker, just a regular non-stick pan. 
                                If it's not non-stick, you won't be able to make "frixuelos" as they'll break when flipping.</li>
                            <li>Once the pan is hot, add a portion of the mixture and tilt the pan to cover the entire base surface. 
                                The amount for a small pan is roughly a little more than half the volume of a kitchen ladle.</li>
                            <li>Let it cook at medium-high heat. When you see the edges starting to come off or turn golden, flip it and let it cook for another 30-40 seconds. 
                                As you make them, you'll easily see when they're done, so don't worry.</li>
                            <li>Place the "frixuelos" on a plate and sprinkle them with sugar as you make them, stacking them on top of each other. 
                                Repeat the process, adding a new drop of oil to the pan each time you start a new "frixuelo."</li>
                            <li>The traditional way to eat them is by rolling them up, and they are best enjoyed while hot. 
                                With very little effort, you'll have a tray ready to enjoy this wonderful Asturian sweet treat.</li>
