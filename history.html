              <h2>Prehistory</h2>
              <p class="info">During the Paleolithic, the earliest inhabitants were hunters and gatherers who left a remarkable artistic 
                legacy in the form of cave paintings in places like the famous Tito Bustillo Cave. 
                Engravings and depictions of animals and human figures reveal the rich spirituality and creativity 
                of these prehistoric inhabitants. <br>
        
                The arrival of the Neolithic brought a fundamental shift in how communities sustained themselves. 
                The adoption of agriculture and the domestication of animals allowed sedentary populations to establish 
                more permanent settlements. The introduction of livestock and the practice of farming marked a 
                turning point in Asturias' history, as people began actively modifying their environment to meet 
                their needs. The construction of more elaborate housing and the creation of more advanced tools reflect 
                the technological and cultural evolution of prehistoric society.

            <h2>Ancient Times and Romanization</h2>
            <p class="info">The Astures were a group of indigenous peoples who inhabited the northwest of the Iberian 
              Peninsula, in what is now the region of Asturias in Spain. They were known for their resistance 
              and bravery against invasions and conquests by other peoples.
              <br><br>
              Romanization in Asturias occurred during the period when the Roman Empire expanded its dominion over the Iberian Peninsula, 
              roughly from the 1st century BC to the 5th century AD. 
              The Romans established settlements, built roads and fortifications, and carried out a cultural and 
              social transformation in the region.
              <br><br>
              During this process of Romanization, the Romans introduced their language, laws, architecture, and forms of 
              social organization in Asturias. Many Roman cities and towns were established in the region, 
              and mining and agriculture developed significantly. Roman roads were also constructed, 
              connecting Asturias with other parts of the peninsula. Despite Roman influence, the Astures did not 
              completely abandon their cultural identity and continued to maintain some of their customs and traditions.

            <h2>From Romanization to the Dawn of the "Reconquista"</h2>
            <p class="info">The period spanning the end of Romanization and the beginning of the Reconquista in 
              Asturias roughly covers the 5th to 8th centuries. After the fall of the Roman Empire, 
              the region of Asturias underwent a period of instability and change, marked by the migration 
              of various Germanic groups and the formation of Christian kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula.
              <br><br>
              During this time, the Visigoths, a Germanic group, established their rule in the Iberian Peninsula, 
              including Asturias. However, in the north, in the mountains of Asturias, a resistance movement against 
              both Visigothic and later Muslim domination emerged. This resistance began in the 8th century with the 
              leader Pelayo, who led the Battle of Covadonga in 722. The victory at Covadonga is considered the 
              starting point of the Reconquista, a gradual process of reclaiming territories occupied by the Muslims.
              <br><br>
              The Battle of Covadonga marked the beginning of the consolidation of an independent Asturian kingdom, 
              known as the Kingdom of Asturias, which became a center of resistance and a stronghold of 
              Christian culture on the peninsula. This period also witnessed the strengthening of Asturian 
              identity and the promotion of Christianity.

            <h2>Middle Ages</h2>
            <p class="info">Following the victory at Covadonga in 722, the Kingdom of Asturias began its gradual 
              expansion, solidifying its independence and expanding its territory. 
              Over the centuries, marital ties and alliances were forged with other Christian kingdoms on the 
              Iberian Peninsula, bolstering its position within the medieval context. <br><br>
      
              As the Middle Ages progressed, the Kingdom of Asturias evolved into the Kingdom of León, 
              which later merged with the Kingdom of Castile to form the political entity of the Kingdom of León 
              and Castile. This process of unifying territories and kingdoms laid the foundation for the future 
              political entity of Spain. <br><br>
              
              During this period, Asturias also played a vital role in the struggle against Muslim rule on the peninsula. 
              Christian kingdoms conducted military campaigns known as the Reconquista, with the aim of reclaiming 
              territories under Muslim control. As they advanced southward, Christian realms reconquered cities and 
              regions that had been under Muslim dominion for centuries. <br><br>
              
              Additionally, Asturias played a significant role in the Camino de Santiago, a pilgrimage route that 
              attracted travelers from across Europe. As part of the Northern Way of the Camino de Santiago, 
              the region contributed to cultural and religious exchange as pilgrims journeyed toward the sanctuary 
              of Santiago de Compostela.

            <h2>Modern Era</h2>
            <p class="info">
              During this period, Asturias, like the rest of Spain, was involved in historically significant 
              global events. The region witnessed the expansion of the Spanish Crown across the world, 
              including the colonization of the Americas and the Philippines. 
              Asturias contributed by providing explorers, navigators, and resources for these colonial enterprises. <br><br>
      
              On the domestic front, the Industrial Revolution had a significant impact on the region. 
              As industrialization progressed in Europe, Asturias became an important mining and steel center. 
              The exploitation of natural resources, such as coal and iron, led to the creation of industries and cities 
              in the region. <br><br>
              
              However, this period was also marked by social and labor tensions. 
              Workers in Asturian industries faced challenging labor conditions and often joined protest 
              movements and strikes to fight for better working conditions and labor rights. <br><br>
              
              On the political front, Spain underwent a series of transformations, including dynastic changes and wars. 
              The 19th century was particularly tumultuous, with the Napoleonic invasion, internal power struggles, 
              and ultimately the restoration of the monarchy.

            <h2>Contemporary Era</h2>
            <p class="info">
              In the economic sphere, Asturias remained a significant industrial center for much of the 20th century, 
              with a focus on mining and steel production. However, as the century progressed, 
              deindustrialization and global competition impacted these industries, 
              leading to economic restructuring and a decline in jobs in these sectors. <br><br>
      
              On the political front, Spain experienced a series of significant changes, such as the Second Republic, 
              the Civil War, and Franco's dictatorship. Asturias was also a site of struggle and resistance, 
              as seen in the October Revolution of 1934, an uprising against the Republic that was violently suppressed. <br><br>
              
              With the transition to democracy in Spain after Franco's death in 1975, Asturias also underwent political changes.
              The region became an Autonomous Community within the framework of power decentralization in Spain, 
              allowing for greater autonomy in decision-making and the promotion of Asturian culture and language. <br><br>
              
              In terms of social and cultural aspects, Asturias has preserved its regional identity and heritage. 
              The Camino de Santiago continues to attract pilgrims and visitors, and the region has worked 
              to preserve its rich cultural and natural heritage. <br><br>
